# Research Question 2

#### Are there code quality indicators correlated with the rising of critical issues?

This research question is aimed at studying the extent to which code quality can be perceived by users in their comments. Our aim is to establish if an higher frequency of certain kind of feedback in the app store could be connected to factors indicating a lower/higher code quality.

As explained in the paper, when consider all the apps together we do not observe any significant correlation, as showed in the heap maps below.

However, some results come up when looking separately at the different categories.
The heat-maps for each separate category can be observed at [this link](cat.md).
